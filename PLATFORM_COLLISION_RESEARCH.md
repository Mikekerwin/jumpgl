# Platform Collision System Research - TODO

## Objective
Port the platform collision system from geminiTut/my-react-app to the JumpGL project.

## Key Requirements to Understand
1. [ ] Platform definition and creation
   - How platforms are defined
   - Hitbox system (smaller and offset from visual sprite)
   - Visual sprite vs collision hitbox relationship

2. [ ] Collision detection
   - Player-platform collision detection mechanism
   - How collisions are detected and handled
   - Hitbox parameters and detection logic

3. [ ] Player physics on platforms
   - How player lands on platforms
   - How player stays on platforms (noted as difficult to get right)
   - Physics behavior when on/off platforms

4. [ ] Platform spawning/serving
   - Sequential platform spawning system
   - Platform generation/serving logic
   - When and how platforms are created

5. [ ] Configuration and constants
   - Platform-related constants
   - Configuration values
   - Physics parameters

## Search Progress
- Starting: 2025-11-20
- Target Directory: /Users/OCSAdmin/Projects/geminiTut/my-react-app/

## Files to Analyze
(Will be populated as search progresses)

## Code Snippets
(Will be documented here for easy reference)

## Next Steps
1. Search for platform-related files
2. Locate collision detection logic
3. Find physics implementation
4. Extract configuration constants
5. Document key code snippets
